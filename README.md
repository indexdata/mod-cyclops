## Overview

This is a FOLIO module providing access to CCD, the server of [the CCMS software](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/indexdata/ccms) that powers CYCLOPS. It presents a somewhat RESTful WSAPI, in contrast the the command-based API of the underlying software, largely so that FOLIO permissions can be applied to the various endpoints.
